There's one thing I have wanted to do for a long time: writing blog posts in English. And here it comes.

I have been writing things here since 2013, but all of them are written in Japanese. That is fine as long as you keep them just for yourself and a few audiences who read your language. But if you write in other languages, you will obviously get more chances that your writings can be read by someone else, and for me that is 10 times larger than the one I used to be writing in.

Anyway I will try some more here, and if you find me, that is great. If you find something intersting, that is super! I will see you soon.
